### Hi, I'm Keval ðŸ‘‹

I think of myself as a Backend & DevOps Engineer, though my curiosity means that I've got knowledge in a lot of areas beyond and around those.

I'm currently working on a few things including but not limited to: my job at Storm Reply where I'm a Cloud Consultant, [FileDepot](posts/filedepot-intro) which is a fast and simple file sharing system, and rambling here about all the above.

If you want to get in touch, my LinkedIn and X profiles are linked above. I don't bite ðŸ˜‰.
