### Hi, I'm Keval ðŸ‘‹

Professionally, I'm somewhere between a Backend Engineer & a DevOps Engineer. In reality though my curiosity means that I know loads around those 2 titles and far beyond (I made a functioning Tesla coil one time).

I'm currently working on a few things including but not limited to: my job at Storm Reply where I'm a Cloud Consultant, [FileDepot](posts/filedepot-intro) which is a fast and simple file sharing system, hooking up some 12 KW inverters to Home Assistant, and rambling here about all the above.

If you want to get in touch (even if it's just to ask how I got my nickname ðŸ˜‰), my LinkedIn and X profiles are linked above.
