### Hi, I'm Keval ðŸ‘‹

Professionally, I'm somewhere between a Backend Engineer & a DevOps Engineer. In reality though my curiosity means that I've got knowledge around those 2 titles and beyond.

I'm currently working on a few things including but not limited to: my job at Storm Reply where I'm a Cloud Consultant, [FileDepot](posts/filedepot-intro) which is a fast and simple file sharing system, and rambling here about all the above.

If you want to get in touch (even if it's just to ask how I got my nickname ðŸ˜‰), my LinkedIn and X profiles are linked above.
