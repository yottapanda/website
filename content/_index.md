Hey there, welcome to my blog! You're in for a whirlwind of my tech adventures and insights. I hope you find it both useful and entertaining.

I'm currently working on a few things including but not limited to: my job at Automated Reception where I'm a DevOps engineer (and everything else too because it's a startup), building a new version of [Syncify](posts/syncify.md), and chipping away at a file storage/sharing system called [File Depot](posts/filedepot-intro.md).
