Hey there, welcome to my blog! You're in for a whirlwind of my tech adventures and insights. I hope you find it both useful and entertaining.

I'm currently working on a few things including but not limited to: my job at Storm Reply where I'm an AWS Cloud Consultant (something between DevOps and Full-Stack), setting up Kubernetes in my Home Lab, and slowly chipping away at a file transfer and storage system I've dubbed FileDepot.
