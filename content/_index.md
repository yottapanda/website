### Hi, I'm Keval ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog! Here, I share my tech adventures and insights. I hope you find it both useful and enjoyable, just as much as I enjoy writing it.

I'm currently working on a few things including but not limited to: my job at Storm Reply where I'm an AWS Cloud Consultant (something between DevOps and Full-Stack), setting up Kubernetes in my Home Lab, and slowly chipping away at a file transfer and storage system I've dubbed FileDepot.

If you want to get in touch (even if it's just to ask how I got my nickname ðŸ˜‰), my LinkedIn and X profiles are linked above.
