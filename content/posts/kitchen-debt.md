## Technical Debt

Recall a time when your manager (non-tech stakeholder) wants a feature done _muy rapido_ (very fast), and you've got to mutilate your otherwise "perfect" codebase to do it. Never a fun time but nonetheless, we both know the possible solutions to this problem:

1. Succumb to the pressure and implement it as fast as possible, leaving a huge mess that will haunt the next poor sod who dares need to make a change in the future.
2. Make your objections known, implement it quickly and vow to fix it afterwards&trade;. You know full well that your manager will have another urgent feature ready to shove down your throat immediately after this one.
3. Agree to implement it, but explicitly state that it will not be done in time. This little maneuver's gonna cost you 2 years on your next promotion.
4. Quit immediately, become a YouTuber, realise you can't make videos, beg for your job back, implement the feature.

None of these are ideal. These are the options because the root of the problem is your stakeholder's lack of understanding of the situation. I'm reaching here, I know. But I came up with an analagy.

## Kitchen Debt

Usually I'm quite tidy in the kitchen. I have no cleaning up to do at the end because I clean as I go. It means I can eat, throw my bowl in the dishwasher, and not have someone yelling at me to clean up so they can use the kitchen. It does take a little longer to work like this but the food turns out better when I fuss over it and there's no mess.

I was rushing to make dinner yesterday (my famous ragu), because my friend called to go bouldering with an hour's notice. Needless to say, my etiquette went straight out the window. I left onion peels on the counter, knives in precarious locations, and numerous unwashed pots/pans sprawled around the cooker. Having inhaled my food and put on my shoes to leave, my mother comes down. She takes one look at the kitchen and says "I'm about to make a cake, clean up your shit". I love my mother dearly and so I left for climbing. She was not happy.

This sounds a lot like tech debt to me. I needed to implement a feature (cook ragu) in a short period of time (bouldering in an hour), leaving technical debt (a mess). The next poor sod (my mum) needed to make a change (cook something else), and was haunted by it (had to clean up my mess first).
